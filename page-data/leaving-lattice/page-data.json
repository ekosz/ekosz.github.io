Unlike most other founders’ stories or articles\nyou may have read, this was not due to me being pushed out, or the company\ngoing bankrupt, nor <em>really</em> about me being burnt out. In fact, Lattice is\ndoing great, far better than I could have ever dreamed when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaltma\">Jack</a>, my\ncofounder, and I started the company a little over 6.5 years ago - we have over\n4,000 customers, 700,000 users, 600+ of our own employees, and our last\nvaluation came in around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/lattice-raises-175m-more-at-a-3b-valuation-for-its-people-management-platform\">$3B dollars</a>. For most startup founders,\nthis would be when things start to get especially interesting, yet I decided\nit’s time for me to move on. I’m writing this partially for those interested in\nthe <strong>why</strong> and partially for my own closure.</p>\n<h2>Starting a company</h2>\n<p>People start companies for different reasons. Some people get obsessed with an\nidea, others do it for the potential wealth they could generate, while others\nmay be swept into it by a friend or colleague who may be motivated by one of\nthose first two. I started Lattice because I felt I had something I needed\nprove to myself.</p>\n<p>My father is a serial entrepreneur who has by now started half a dozen\nbusinesses. Some of them were very successful; others, spectacular failures.\nHe’s someone who loves the challenge of building and has an amazing gift for\ncombining his knowledge across various fields (chemistry, physics,\nmanufacturing, etc) into business ideas. That all said, growing up I didn’t see\nmuch of my father. He worked all day, came home to join us for dinner, then\nholed himself up in his office to continue working for the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>I discovered pretty early on that the best way to get my father’s attention\nwould be to ask him about his work. At that point, he would light up and easily\ngo on for an hour or two about exactly what he was working on, strategies\nemployed, and so forth. I grew up listening to my father’s corporate escapades,\nabout taking on far bigger businesses and winning. Stories about creating then\napplying trade secrets to transform the markets he operated in.</p>\n<p>Growing up surrounded by these stories, always looking up to my father but also\nnever feeling like I had his approval or attention, gave me a chip on my\nshoulder. If he could do it all, could I? And if I was successful, maybe\nI could earn his respect.</p>\n<h2>Growing a business</h2>\n<p>Lattice started much the way typical startups in Silicon Valley do, with\na noticeable problem and a desire to do it better/easier/faster. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaltma\">Jack</a>\nand I worked together at a rapidly scaling startup called Teespring that, as\nmore employees joined, seemed to lose sight of the culture and importance of\ninvesting in employees. We asked ourselves, ‘Could we fix Teespring’s issues\nwith technology?’ and that became the basis for all of Lattice.</p>\n<p>The first year of Lattice was a lot of work, then a lot of existential dread,\nand finally, a lot of fun. For the first 7 months, it was <em>just</em> Jack and I.\nJack would handle all of the business bits while I built the entirety of the\nproduct. We didn’t kill ourselves by any means, but it still meant programming\nfor 9+ hours a day, 6 days a week. 4 months in we had done a lot of work, but\nstill had no real validation (customers) and that’s where the existential dread\ncame from.</p>\n<p>I very vividly remember sitting with Jack outside on the grass asking each\nother if we were just wasting our time/lives on this project. Both of us had\nother opportunities that would pay well and be a whole lot less work. The\nproject we poured our time, effort, and passion into for the last 4 months had\nnot made a drop of difference to anyone. Plus, there wasn’t really any end in\nsight. But we ultimately decided that we were going to give it another couple\nof months and see what happens. I’m glad we did. As soon as we started getting\nour early customers, everything changed.</p>\n<p>There is a night and day difference between having customers and not as\na startup. Suddenly, we had people who cared about Lattice (other than just\nJack and I). And they were paying us! Instead of Jack and I just theorizing\nwhat would be a good idea to build or add to Lattice, we had a group of users\nwe could just ask. Or, even better, they would tell us exactly what sucked\nabout our product and we could fix it. It felt great, made us feel like we had\na purpose again, and not just floating in space. Before we knew it there was\nmore work than Jack and I could handle ourselves and we had to hire others. And\nthat’s when Lattice really became a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>I love Latticians (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym\">demonym</a> of people who work at Lattice). The\npeople who resonate with our company mission, “Make work meaningful”, and want\nto solve human issues all day are the exact type of people I love being around.\nEveryone who joined us was genuinely humble, who just wanted to do right by one\nanother and our customers, and were motivated to do good work. Some of our\nearliest hires also ended up being some of my best friends. The work we did\nback then didn’t suddenly get easier, in fact in many ways it got harder once\nwe had employees, but at least there were now others to problem-solve or\ncommiserate over the work with. We would have a long day at the office, but\nwould then be able to go across the street to a bar and unwind. Overcoming\nshared struggles felt amazing and made me feel like I had found my community.</p>\n<p>We continued to steadily grow and, by the end of 2019, had gone through\n3 offices and had grown to ~125 people. Things were going great, until\nsomething that would change my relationship with Lattice.</p>\n<h2>The pandemic</h2>\n<p>In March of 2020, we were one of the first businesses to go fully remote. And\nnot by our choice. One day we showed up to the office to find it locked with\na note saying that a member of the building staff team had gotten COVID and the\noffice was shut down until further notice. That office never opened up again\nfor us.</p>\n<p>Some people love working from home. It gives them the flexibility they want, it\nallows them to see their families more, and it saves them a ton of commuting\ntime. But as a single guy that truly didn’t have much going on outside of work,\nit felt like I was being ripped away from the community that I loved so much.\nZoom was just not the same as being in the office together. And if I didn’t\nwork directly with someone, there was suddenly no reason for me to ever see or\ninteract with them. Without the people-side of things all I was really left\nwith was the work itself.</p>\n<h2>The work</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/\">YC</a>, one of the mantras they drill into founders is that the two tasks\none should prioritize over everything else are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Talking to customers</li>\n<li>Shipping solutions to their problems</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re not doing one of those two things you should either not do it or keep\nit to a minimum. Thankfully, those are the two things I love doing more than\nanything else. I find talking to users of a thing I built awesome and super\nenergizing. And I also love building things, especially if they make someone’s\nlife better in some way. This gets even more exciting when they’re then willing\nto pay you for that thing you built because it does what they need it to do.</p>\n<p>But as Lattice became bigger and more successful, I found it harder to <em>just</em>\ndo those two things. Once you’re a successful, scaling organization, you need\nto start focusing on roadmapping, prioritizing, getting cross-functional\nalignment, driving technical initiatives, dealing with interpersonal issues,\nhiring (oh so much hiring), and more. None of these are unimportant tasks.\nDoing these things allow the people doing the <em>real</em> work, the ICs, to mostly\nfocus on talking to customers and shipping solutions. As things changed,\nI realized these new responsibilities were not the things that drove personal\nsatisfaction for myself.</p>\n<p>Now you may be starting to say, “Well Eric, aren’t you a cofounder? Can’t you\nwork on whatever you want? Can’t you <em>just</em> work on talking to customers and\nshipping solutions if that’s what you want to do?“. Truth is, you’re most\nlikely correct. If I was better at organization crafting maybe I could have\ncreated a situation like that. I know I tried many times to do just that. But\nin each situation I eventually (and probably rightfully) kept getting pulled\nback out to work on higher-level issues. As cofounder and CTO there are just\na class of problems I cannot turn a blind eye to.</p>\n<p>And so I kept finding myself in these cycles where I was no longer satisfied or\nhappy with the work I was doing.</p>\n<h2>Practicing what we preach</h2>\n<p>At Lattice, we often talk about “Ikigai”. “Ikigai” is a Japanese word\n<a href=\"https://ikigaitribe.com/ikigai/podcast07/\">miss-applied to a Spanish astrology concept</a>. But etymology aside,\nwhat we’re referring to is the concept of having your work be in alignment with\nyour purpose and be a source of happiness. We’ve strived to create an\nenvironment in Lattice where if an employee no longer feels alignment with\ntheir role that they’re empowered to take action. Maybe that’s as easy as\ntaking a break, but often it requires a lot more than that. Sometimes it’s\nchanging projects or teams. Other times it’s trying out a lateral move to\na different position within the same organization. But we also tell our\nemployees, sometimes it’s Lattice itself which is the source of lack of\nsatisfaction and that is <em>okay</em>. It’s okay to no longer be satisfied with the\nwork you do at the company and to want to seek your next opportunity elsewhere.\nThat is the natural cycle of employment and something we’re here to support our\nemployees through that transition.</p>\n<p>But what I didn’t realize when I was speaking about this over the past few\nyears was that it would one day apply to myself as well.</p>\n<p>While I’m incredibly proud of what Lattice has become and the impact it has on\nthe world, it’s become time for me to move on to the next part of my journey.</p>\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n<p>I’m not leaving Lattice completely. I’ll still be on Lattice’s board and will\ncontinue to advise the company, especially when it comes to the larger\nstrategic initiatives. But, with much reflection, I’ve decided to start a new\ncompany. I’m excited to try this all over again and revisit the excitement of\nthose early days. However, I’m going to be building something very different\nfrom Lattice. Now that I better understand myself and my motivations, I’ve\ndecided to create a community-based product, as well as combine a few other of\nmy passions into one cohesive business.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in online communities, video platforms, the creator\neconomy, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber\">VTubers</a>, and want to join me on this next adventure\nplease reach out!
