Each workout machine works a different muscle. One\nmight work your biceps, another your calfs, and another one your lateral\nmuscles. Most gym goers hop from machine to machine until they feel that they\nhave worked all their body.</p>\n<p>Maybe in the corner of the gym you’ll see a single hollow metal box with a barbell.\nThis is called a “power rack” and is avoided my 90% of gym goers. Barbell\nexercises are mostly a lost art form as they are thought to be dangerous and\nreserved for professional body builders. But this is a fallacy brought to life\nby gym owners in the past 35 years. Most gyms don’t want you to do barbell\nexercises. It requires their personal trainers to have more training, the\nhorror, and is considered a legal liability.</p>\n<p>If the workout machines were just as good as doing barbell exercises, this\nwouldn’t be a problem. But they are not. The machines provide isolation\nexercises while barbell exercises are compound exercises. Working one muscle at\na time has many downfalls. If you are only working a single\nmuscle, you can’t move much weight. This is a problem because it is hard to\nprogress in strength. If you are doing 30 pound bicep curls and the machine\nincreases in 10 pound increments you’re suddenly doing 30% more weight when\nyou more to the next level. This is near impossible. But if you’re doing 100\npound chest presses with a bar, and increase by 5 pounds your only increasing\nyour weight by 5% that is distributed across multiple muscle groups. This\nallows one to make progress in their weights every time they visit the gym.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Compound vs isolation exercises","date":"November 13, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/dont-bundle-your-dependencies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Don't bind your dependencies to one another"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"2824a001-be8e-57d0-ab29-041d1750ef71","previousPostId":"fe19737f-ff9e-5230-8c60-1fcf3bc41b67","nextPostId":null}},
