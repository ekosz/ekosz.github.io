Trying to\nkeep the insides nice and compact, I used zip ties to bind the wires together.\nAfter assembling the insides of the computer I started working with my\nexternal accessories. I had a keyboard, mouse, microphone, and webcam.\nI figured I would use the same principles as I did inside the computer. Using\nsome more zip ties I bound all of my accessories wires together. This worked\ngreat up until this week when my new keyboard arrived.</p>\n<p>I unwrapped my new keyboard from its packaging and instantly tried to remove my\nold keyboard from my desk. The problem was that every time I tried to remove\nthe keyboard, the mouse would be dragged off the desk with it. When I tried\ngetting my mouse more slack, the microphone would fall over.</p>\n<p>I realized that I had to cut the zip ties I had put on years ago, but there was\nyet another problem. The ties were bound so tight that I couldn’t get he scissors\naround the tie, without being dangerously close to cutting the wires of my\naccessories.</p>\n<p>After a couple hours work of using knife from my kitchen I was finally able to\nremove my old keyboard without pulling the rest of my equipment off of my desk.\nWhat was supposed to be a relatively easy task, replacing a keyboard, turned\ninto a nightmare because I couldn’t replace one external dependency without\ntouching the rest of them.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Don't bind your dependencies to one another","date":"November 12, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/introduction-to-juggling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction to juggling"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/compound-vs-isolation-exercises/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Compound vs isolation exercises"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fe19737f-ff9e-5230-8c60-1fcf3bc41b67","previousPostId":"f314fbb4-e1f7-50d9-9c03-aaac77f9dec4","nextPostId":"2824a001-be8e-57d0-ab29-041d1750ef71"}},
