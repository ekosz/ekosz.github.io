As consultants its our job to\nmake our clients happy, but more impotently make their businesses better for\nhiring us. For clients to hire consultants and give them access to their code\nrequires trust. They are passing off their baby and golden goose to us. If they\ndon’t trust who they have hired, they’ll get spooked and take their business\nelsewhere.</p>\n<p>Thats why even if you’re the most competent programmer in the world and you\nhave brought back dozens of projects back from the brink of death, if you don’t\nlook and act the part none of that matters. The problem is that clients can’t\nsee into your head. They don’t see the knowledge that is there or the skill you\nwield. They see you, how you dress, how you talk, and how you carry yourself.</p>\n<p>If you don’t look and act the part you will leave a bad impression, no matter\nwhat. Egos serve no purpose when dealing with clients.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Looking the part","date":"October 17, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/writing-a-super-simple-lisp-interpreter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Writing a super simple lisp interpreter"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/wear-your-rain-coat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wear your rain coat"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"273d304d-b278-5ebd-9451-b91dea853bb6","previousPostId":"db56a098-0f9f-5280-ae48-b77b709ffb5d","nextPostId":"30b279c8-6298-5464-989a-5830c1ada278"}},
