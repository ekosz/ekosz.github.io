One of the tools I have started using to help me recognize and locate\ncode smells is “Static Code Analysis”.</p>\n<p>Static code analysis is the process of running a program that instead of\nrunning your code, looks at how it was written. Though there are many of these\ntools out there, the two I’ve become reliant on are <a href=\"https://github.com/troessner/reek\">Reek</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/codegram/pelusa\">Pelusa</a>.</p>\n<h3>Reek</h3>\n<p>Reek is the older of the two tools and provides a good foundation for programmers to\nget started with.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">threebythree_implementations/brute_force_implementation.rb -- 5 warnings:\n  TicTacToe::BruteForceImplementation#block_fork! has approx 7 statements (LongMethod)\n  TicTacToe::BruteForceImplementation#corner_from_index has approx 6 statements (LongMethod)\n  TicTacToe::BruteForceImplementation#each_position calls Board::SIZE.times twice (Duplication)\n  TicTacToe::BruteForceImplementation#each_position contains iterators nested 2 deep (NestedIterators)\n  TicTacToe::BruteForceImplementation#each_position doesn't depend on instance state (LowCohesion)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Reek looks at ones code, and provides a quick summary for whats wrong. The\nbest part of reek, is its <a href=\"https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Code-Smells\">Wiki</a>.<br>\nThere one can get detailed descriptions of the code smells it finds, how suggestions\nhow how to fix them.</p>\n<h3>Pelusa</h3>\n<p>Pelusa is a relatively new comer to the SCA tools and definitely not for the faint\nof heart. Based on <a href=\"http://binstock.blogspot.com/2008/04/perfecting-oos-small-classes-and-short.html\">this blog post</a> Pelusa is a harsh grader.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">class GameTree\n    ✿ Is below 50 lines ✗\n  This class has 63 lines.\n    ✿ Uses less than 3 ivars ✗\n  This class uses 5 instance variables: @evaluator, @state, @depth, @alpha, @beta.\n    ✿ Respects Demeter law ✗\n  There are 1 Demeter law violations in lines 123.\n    ✿ Doesn't use more than one indentation level inside methods ✗\n  There's too much indentation in lines 138, 157.\n    ✿ Doesn't use else clauses ✓\n    ✿ Doesn't use getters, setters or properties ✓\n    ✿ Doesn't mix array instance variables with others ✓\n    ✿ Uses descriptive names ✓\n    ✿ Methods have short argument lists ✗\n  Methods with more than 3 arguments: initialize\n    ✿ Doesn't use eval statement ✓</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see, Pelusa goes the extra step to make sure your code is following\nthe very best OO design patterns. Getting a perfect score may be hard, but if\ndone, your code will thank you.</p>\n<p>As one grows as a programmer, they’ll probably find that SCA tools become less\nuseful as they can spots smells easier. But for new programmers trying to up\ntheir game, I can’t suggest them enough.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Static code analysis","date":"July 12, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/minimax-tic-tac-toe/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Minimax tic tac toe"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/the-danger-of-too-many-classes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The danger of too many classes"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"55c4a19a-3902-5433-bfc2-39eab365fa54","previousPostId":"38ae9550-6f6d-5783-8dc5-92572756b134","nextPostId":"2c615873-0300-58d4-8f3d-1fbd221c152c"}},
