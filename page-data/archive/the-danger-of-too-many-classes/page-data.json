But there is\na danger of refactoring too much. By following all the right rules, even while\nsupposedly doing the right thing, your code may become a mess.</p>\n<p>This happened to me. Using the two tools I mentioned, Pelusa and Reek, I had\nrefactored one of my algorithms from class to 6, and doubled my code size.\nEvery class was shorter, but combined they caused a new problem.</p>\n<p>As programmers, we have to juggle many concepts at the same time while solving\na problem. Each class I introduced added another ball I had to mentally keep\ntrack of. Eventually I couldn’t remember the difference between GameState and\nGameMove and when I should use one or the other.</p>\n<p>The beauty of refactoring comes from its balance. The goal of refactoring is to\nmake your code more expressive and understandable. It is very easy to refactor\ntoo much and too far and the code emerges more scattered and confusing than\nany time before.</p>\n<p>Before you extract another class ask yourself, does this make my problem\neasier to understand. If not, you’re doing something wrong.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The danger of too many classes","date":"July 16, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/static-code-analysis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Static code analysis"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/getting-started-with-ruby-curses/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Ruby curses"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c615873-0300-58d4-8f3d-1fbd221c152c","previousPostId":"55c4a19a-3902-5433-bfc2-39eab365fa54","nextPostId":"0ed22dbf-1302-5bbf-9854-df2c486b0081"}},
