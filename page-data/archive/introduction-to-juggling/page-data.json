Throwing from hand to hand</h3>\n<p>The first step to juggling is working your hand eye coronation. Start with one\nball, and practice throwing it from your right hand to your left. Try to throw\nthe ball at the same height every time. The less your have to move your hands\nthe better.</p>\n<p>Do this until catching the ball is easy and your rarely drop the ball.</p>\n<h3>2. Throwing two balls</h3>\n<p>Its time to graduate to two balls. Many people when the start to jungle try\nthrowing both balls at the same time. This is wrong and doesn’t help you learn\nto juggle. To properly practice with two balls start with one ball in each\nhand. Start just like you did before and toss the first ball from your right\nhand to your left. A second before the ball reaches your left hand throw the\nleft ball up in the air. Catch the ball in your left hand and don’t worry\nabout catching the ball in the air.</p>\n<p>Make sure that the ball you throw in the air goes up and not sideways. Again,\nrepeat this motion until you aren’t dropping any balls. When your comfortable,\ntry catching the second ball in the air with your right hand. It may be\ndifficult at first to get the timing down, but with a short amount of practice\nyou’ll find your rhythm.</p>\n<h3>3. Juggling</h3>\n<p>Juggling with three balls is the biggest mental hurdle, but believe it or not\nby now you have all the skills you need to juggle. Start now with three balls,\ntwo in your right hand and one in your left. Start as you always have throwing\none ball from your right to your left. Again, right before it lands throw your\nleft ball to your right. Wrapping it all together, you are going to repeat\nexactly what you just did, but mirrored. Right before your left ball reaches\nyour right hand throw the last ball to the left just as you did in the\nbeginning. Congratulations your juggling.</p>\n<p>Wash, rinse, and repeat these motions trying to juggling more and more times in\na row. From here its pure practice until you can juggle like a pro.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction to juggling","date":"October 26, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/work-better-not-faster/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Work better not faster"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/dont-bundle-your-dependencies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Don't bind your dependencies to one another"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f314fbb4-e1f7-50d9-9c03-aaac77f9dec4","previousPostId":"0f6d12ce-be62-57aa-90a3-2ca348928167","nextPostId":"fe19737f-ff9e-5230-8c60-1fcf3bc41b67"}},
