It turns\nout that that post is already outdated information.</p>\n<h3>What happened?</h3>\n<p>This morning Elixir 0.6.0 was released and with that release the Mix project.\nMix is a tool written in Elixir that replaces Make. Mix tracks dependences,\npackages your applications, runs tests and generally makes life better as\na Elixir developer.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested you can read about the project <a href=\"http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix.html\">on the elixir\nsite</a>.</p>\n<h3>What does this mean?</h3>\n<p>Open source software moves fast. Like really fast. The last version of Elixir\nwas released 2 months ago, and already much as changed in development\npractices. There were 453 commits between Elixir 0.5.0 and 0.6.0. Thats about\n8 commits a day. 18,000 lines were added and 7,000 were removed.</p>\n<p>Because so much is going on all the time, without being deeply involved in an OSS\ncommunity, its hard to contribute back to it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Outdated in 60 secs","date":"August 01, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/elixir-make-files/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Elixir make files"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/endless-pagination-in-jekyll/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Endless pagination in Jekyll"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7e712969-43c8-56ed-9d71-a1905ba421e6","previousPostId":"cbf6bee7-0444-5a7f-9705-a529d8123357","nextPostId":"bd2ad3ea-8ed4-5473-ba68-623ea1e163be"}},
