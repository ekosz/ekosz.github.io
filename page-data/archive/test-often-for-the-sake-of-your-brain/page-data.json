Even when I’ve only edited a couple lines of\ncode, I run my tests. To me, tests are a way of saving my precious brain\ncycles and time. Looking at different piece of code requires me to load up that\ncode’s mind state which takes a non-zero amount of time.</p>\n<p>My current process looks like this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>load up a piece of code (x time)</li>\n<li>make changes (y time)</li>\n<li>run tests (z time)\nif tests pass, dump memory and move on\nelse go back to 2</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this process x is constant and y and z have scalers.</p>\n<p>If I didn’t run my tests often my process would look more like</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>load up a piece of code (x time)</li>\n<li>make changes (y time)</li>\n<li>load up a new piece of code (x time)</li>\n<li>make changes (y time)</li>\n<li>run tests(z time)\nif tests pass, dump memory move on\nelse if tests break on code 1, go to 1\nelse go to 4</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this process x, y, and z all of scalers.</p>\n<p>The problem here is that bugs bubble up. If I’m working on multiple pieces of\ncode, I’ll have to keep keep dumping and loading new states of mind. The time\nit takes to switch states builds up and soon half your day is spent trying to\nremember what you were doing the other half.</p>\n<p>This is also the reason distraction can be so distributive to work. When\na developer gets distracted they automatically dump their memory so they can\ninterpret the distraction. Then afterwords they need to spend x time to load\nup the code again.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Test often, for the sake of your brain","date":"October 23, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/slow-tests-kill-the-developer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slow tests kill the developer"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/demoing-to-the-customer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Demoing to the customer"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3a511dac-4b2a-5ffa-8ef5-e2bdf4652172","previousPostId":"53613a3a-22d3-53c8-80a7-f5d1dd9bcf01","nextPostId":"50e67919-5489-5c30-a78c-15f23a565033"}},
