On these days you are given many opportunities. If the\ncustomer is new, you have a change to really wow them and get the relationship\ngoing on the right foot. If you and the customer have been going through a rough\npatch a demo is the perfect time to remind them why they hired you and give\nthem new-found confidence in your work.</p>\n<p>Demo days are also the worst times for things to go wrong. If someone blows up\nin your face in front of the customer their opinion of you and your work will\nplummet fast. And it will be your fault. There is no excuse for something\ngoing wrong during the demo. The demo for that day should have been rehearsed\nin its entirety multiple times. Demos should also have a code freeze attached\nto them. You don’t want some “bug fix” that morning to screw up what you have\npracticed demoing the night before.</p>\n<p>Demos are the glue that bind you to your customer. If you demo often and well\nthe customer will build their trust in you and keep brining you their business.\nIf you don’t demo often, or worse, have a bad demo they will begin to worry and\nstart to think about how other developers might be a safer option.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Demoing to the customer","date":"October 24, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/test-often-for-the-sake-of-your-brain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Test often, for the sake of your brain"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/work-better-not-faster/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Work better not faster"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"50e67919-5489-5c30-a78c-15f23a565033","previousPostId":"3a511dac-4b2a-5ffa-8ef5-e2bdf4652172","nextPostId":"0f6d12ce-be62-57aa-90a3-2ca348928167"}},
