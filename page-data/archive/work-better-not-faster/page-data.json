Without deadlines\nprojects could last forever. A little known fact about the TV South Park is\nthat its episodes are made every week in only 6 days. One of the creators of\nSouth Park stated that if they didn’t have such a tight deadline every week it\nwould take the team 2 months to create each episode, while only improving the\nquality of them by 2%.</p>\n<p>You would think that with tight deadlines sprinting to the end to meet all of\nthe requirements is the best strategy, but its not. Sprinting and staying up late\nmight get the job done, but it will make the job you’ve done be bootsy.</p>\n<p>It is is a false statement that when your behind your work can be done or good,\nbut not both. If the work you create is not of high quality its not done.\nPeriod.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No matter who. No matter what. No matter when. Short term.Long term. Any\nterm.
