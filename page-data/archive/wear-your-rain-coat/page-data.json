These\ndependencies can show up as HTTP calls to foreign servers, third party libraries\n(gems, jars, etc), or in a particularly large project maybe even calling into\na service written by another team.</p>\n<p>Every time we use one of these third parties our own code becomes more tightly\ncoupled to the third party’s interface. What happens when we decide to update\nour dependency and the interface has changed? We have to go throughout our\nentire application and change how we interact with that dependency at every\nlocation.</p>\n<p>We can protect ourselves from this scenario using a rain-coat. A rain-coat\nclass wraps our dependencies. At first it can act as a simple delegator,\nkeeping the same interface and transparently call through to the dependency.<br>\nBut, when the dependency’s interface changes, it switches to be an adapter. Our\nrain-coat keeps the same interface, but modifies itself to keep working with\nthe new interface of the dependency. And the rest of our application code is\nnone the wiser.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Wear your rain coat","date":"October 19, 2012","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/looking-the-part/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Looking the part"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/slow-tests-kill-the-developer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slow tests kill the developer"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"30b279c8-6298-5464-989a-5830c1ada278","previousPostId":"273d304d-b278-5ebd-9451-b91dea853bb6","nextPostId":"53613a3a-22d3-53c8-80a7-f5d1dd9bcf01"}},
