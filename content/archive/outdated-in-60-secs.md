In my last post I talked about Make and Makefiles in Elixir projects. It turns
out that that post is already outdated information.

### What happened?

This morning Elixir 0.6.0 was released and with that release the Mix project.
Mix is a tool written in Elixir that replaces Make. Mix tracks dependences,
packages your applications, runs tests and generally makes life better as
a Elixir developer.

If you're interested you can read about the project [on the elixir
site](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix.html).

### What does this mean?

Open source software moves fast. Like really fast. The last version of Elixir
was released 2 months ago, and already much as changed in development
practices. There were 453 commits between Elixir 0.5.0 and 0.6.0. Thats about
8 commits a day. 18,000 lines were added and 7,000 were removed.

Because so much is going on all the time, without being deeply involved in an OSS
community, its hard to contribute back to it.
