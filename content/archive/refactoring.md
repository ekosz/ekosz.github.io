Programs rot. Without tender love and care, they become unmaintainable. They
only way to fight this process is through continuous refactoring.

A feature is not done when its working. Its done after its working and
refactored. There is no set and forget in the software world. If we move on
from a piece of code, before we refactor, we add to the projects technical
dept. Do this too often, and the team will be forced to try and write a check
that it can't cash.

If you are afraid to refactor, as it might break existing code, write more
tests. Tests prove that software works. With near 100% test coverage one can
be sure that if the test pass, nothing is broken. Keep writing tests until
your fears are gone. With no fear, a team can refactor to their hearts'
content.
