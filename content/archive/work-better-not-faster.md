title: Work better not faster

Deadlines are stressful, difficult to meet, and necessary. Without deadlines
projects could last forever. A little known fact about the TV South Park is
that its episodes are made every week in only 6 days. One of the creators of
South Park stated that if they didn't have such a tight deadline every week it
would take the team 2 months to create each episode, while only improving the
quality of them by 2%.

You would think that with tight deadlines sprinting to the end to meet all of
the requirements is the best strategy, but its not. Sprinting and staying up late
might get the job done, but it will make the job you've done be bootsy.

It is is a false statement that when your behind your work can be done or good,
but not both. If the work you create is not of high quality its not done.
Period.
