title: Demoing to the customer

Demo days are important.  On these days you are given many opportunities.  If the
customer is new, you have a change to really wow them and get the relationship
going on the right foot.  If you and the customer have been going through a rough
patch a demo is the perfect time to remind them why they hired you and give
them new-found confidence in your work.

Demo days are also the worst times for things to go wrong.  If someone blows up
in your face in front of the customer their opinion of you and your work will
plummet fast.  And it will be your fault.  There is no excuse for something
going wrong during the demo.  The demo for that day should have been rehearsed
in its entirety multiple times. Demos should also have a code freeze attached
to them.  You don't want some "bug fix" that morning to screw up what you have
practiced demoing the night before.

Demos are the glue that bind you to your customer.  If you demo often and well
the customer will build their trust in you and keep brining you their business.
If you don't demo often, or worse, have a bad demo they will begin to worry and
start to think about how other developers might be a safer option.
