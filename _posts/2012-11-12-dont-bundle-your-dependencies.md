title: don't bind your dependencies to one another
---
A few years ago I was assembling my main computer from scratch.  Trying to
keep the insides nice and compact, I used zip ties to bind the wires together.
After assembling the insides of the computer I started working with my
external accessories.  I had a keyboard, mouse, microphone, and webcam.
I figured I would use the same principles as I did inside the computer.  Using
some more zip ties I bound all of my accessories wires together.  This worked
great up until this week when my new keyboard arrived.

I unwrapped my new keyboard from its packaging and instantly tried to remove my
old keyboard from my desk.  The problem was that every time I tried to remove
the keyboard, the mouse would be dragged off the desk with it. When I tried
getting my mouse more slack, the microphone would fall over.

I realized that I had to cut the zip ties I had put on years ago, but there was
yet another problem. The ties were bound so tight that I couldn't get he scissors
around the tie, without being dangerously close to cutting the wires of my
accessories.

After a couple hours work of using knife from my kitchen I was finally able to
remove my old keyboard without pulling the rest of my equipment off of my desk.
What was supposed to be a relatively easy task, replacing a keyboard, turned
into a nightmare because I couldn't replace one external dependency without
touching the rest of them.
