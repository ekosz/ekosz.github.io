Programs rot. Without tender love and care, they become unmaintainable.  They
only way to fight this process is through continuous refactoring.

A feature is not done when its working.  Its done after its working and
refactored.  There is no set and forget in the software world. If we move on
from a piece of code, before we refactor, we add to the projects technical
dept.  Do this too often, and the team will be forced to try and write a check
that it can't cash.  

If you are afraid to refactor, as it might break existing code, write more
tests.  Tests prove that software works.  With near 100% test coverage one can
be sure that if the test pass, nothing is broken.  Keep writing tests until
your fears are gone.  With no fear, a team can refactor to their hearts'
content.
