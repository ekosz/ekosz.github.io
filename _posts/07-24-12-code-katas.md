When I was a kid I remember taking a karate class for gym.  During the class
we were taught to perform "katas".  Katas were a series of moves that would be
performed after one another in a set sequence. Almost like a dance. Right
punch, left punch, right kick, left kick, etc. To a 8 year old I thought it was
the most boring thing in the world. And when I learned about Code Katas many
years later, I had the same wrong first impression.

Code Katas are problems that programmer can preform over and over again.  The
focus isn't on the answer to the problem, but the process in which its solved.
Katas are meant to help practice good TDD habits and train programmers to look
at problems as a series of failing tests.

Though katas may a first glace seem like a waste of time, they aren't.  After
trying out a few, and solving them over and over again I definitely felt the
Flow.  The Flow is the feeling one gets when they are doing TDD right. Red,
Green, Refactor. Almost every programmer knows this idiom, but I don't think
they all have felt it.  TDD, when done correctly, is a super responsive feed back
loop.

1. Don't write any production code without writing failing test
2. Don't write more test code than it takes to create a failing test
3. Don't write more production code than it takes to pass the test

When following these steps each TDD loop should take a little under a minute.
After doing this 15 minutes strait one will start to feel the Flow, and 
productivity will take off.

Every programmer should practice katas as they teach how to get into the Flow.
Once in the Flow you're biggest worry becomes how to make sure you're not
taken out of the Flow.
