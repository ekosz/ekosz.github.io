Problems of slow test:

1) If running your tests takes a non-trivial amount of time, you'll be more reluctant 
to run them.  

2) If tests start to become a chore, then we'd be more willing to move on to new
tasks without first finding out if there are bugs in what we just did.  

3) If tests run in lengths of minutes.  While we watch the test suite we are slowly
forgetting what were just working on.

4) Long tests cause stress.

5) Stress leads to anger.

6) Anger leads to hate. 

7) Hate leads to suffering.
